# NBA-Games-Project
My first project as part of the training course "Python for Data Analysis"

The data is about NBA (National Basketball Association) games from 2004 season to Dec, 2020.
This project focusing on importing data and data manipulation techniques. It is also convenient to be used for predicting NBA games winners.
